**Hashing and Steganography Web Application**

**Description:**
This repository contains the source code for a web application that provides functionalities for both hashing and steganography. The application is designed to ensure data integrity through hashing algorithms and confidentiality through steganographic techniques. Users can easily hash text or files and hide confidential information within digital images using the web interface.

**Features:**
- **Hashing:** Supports popular hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc. Users can input text or upload files for hashing and verify the integrity of files by comparing hash values.
- **Steganography:** Implements various steganographic techniques like LSB (Least Significant Bit), DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), etc. Users can hide text or files within images and extract hidden data from steganographic images.
- **Responsive UI:** Designed with a responsive user interface for accessibility across different devices and screen sizes.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
